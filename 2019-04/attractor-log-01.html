      <h1><a href="#attractor-log-01">Quantum Attractor Log 1</a></h1>
      <p>This post is part of a series involving the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/">Fatum Bot</a>.</p>

      <p>Welcome to the beginning of my adventures with the Fatum Bot. This bot is meant to generate locations, called "quantum attractors", which are somehow considered significant. I don't care much for the mathematics or mysticism involved at the moment, and will just visit generated quantum attractors and log the results.</p>

      <p>My first attractor was of power 2.19.</p>

      <p>My second attractor was of power 6.43.</p>

      <figcaption><p>Community members often use slang such as "tree rats"</p></figcaption>

      <p>Baby monkeys are the monomania of these users, most of whom fixate their hatred not on all monkeys, but on baby monkeys specifically. They often cheer on adult monkeys who injure the baby monkeys in the videos. Community members organize playlists with names such as "baby monkeys suffering", "i hate baby monkey", and others:</p>

      <p>The videos in these "torture porn" playlists are mostly of Cambodian zoo channels, which showcase interactions between baby monkeys and their mothers. These videos house hundreds of comments of hatred and elaborate torture fantasies, all highly upvoted. One would think that such a community would stem from the third-world, but the majority of commenter names appear Western. Commenters either overwhelm the comment section, or are not present. Hence, is likely that there is private group where specific videos are shared and commented on.</p>
