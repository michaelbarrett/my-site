      <h2>What's with the baby monkey torture videos on Youtube?</h2>
      <p>It's piquant how the internet unites disperse individuals with strange pathologies. Go to Youtube and type in "baby monkey pity" or "monkey pain", "monkey torture", etc. You'll find that there is a community, which has existed since the dawn of Youtube, devoted to sharing these so-called "monkey torture" videos.</p>

      <figcaption><p>Community members often use slang such as "tree rats"</p></figcaption>

      <p>Baby monkeys are the monomania of these users, most of whom fixate their hatred not on all monkeys, but on baby monkeys specifically. They often cheer on adult monkeys who injure the baby monkeys in the videos. Community members organize playlists with names such as "baby monkeys suffering", "i hate baby monkey", and others:</p>

      <p>The videos in these "torture porn" playlists are mostly of Cambodian zoo channels, which showcase interactions between baby monkeys and their mothers. These videos house hundreds of comments of hatred and elaborate torture fantasies, all highly upvoted. One would think that such a community would stem from the third-world, but the majority of commenter names appear Western. Commenters either overwhelm the comment section, or are not present. Hence, is likely that there is private group where specific videos are shared and commented on.</p>

      <p>In the comments, users share their vivid torture fantasies, aspiring to cartoonish extremities of violence and gore fetishism, rivaling the most hardcore snuff literotica. For example, a comment posted by user "Wan Hou":</p>

      <blockquote>
	"Me and my friends nail the babies to trees all the time by their hands and feet. We face them away from the tree so that they cant hide face or cling. I love when they spaz out while being nailed down. They live for weeks like this so we have lots of fun with it. They screech and spaz till they die.

Sometimes we slowly boil them holding their heads above water so we can hear that screech for hours. Everyone kills the babies for fun in Asia these rats spread disease. They are so stupid too. I beat one over and over and it kept trying to cling on my leg as if it wasn't the same person that was beating it to death. We catch at least one baby a week to torture.

I nail one to tree by its ball sac but it ripped it off and ran away. I caught it and cut off all its arms and legs. I burned shut its limbs and it lived for three days with just a tail and would roll and shake"
      </blockquote>

      <p>When the community is present on a video, the opposition to the grotesque comments consists of puppeting pleas of pity for the baby monkeys; creating a funny dynamic, or dialectic, between the cartoonish violence and the begging for mercy. There is also a curious mismatch between the innocent content in most of the videos, which show baby monkeys and their mothers, and the grotesque violence described by users. Examples of comments follow, but I encourage readers to look up the keywords and explore the baby monkey hate K-hole for themselves: </p>

      <p>A few users are more eccentric, and go on long diatribes or comical depictions: </p>

      <h2>Explanations?</h2>
      <p>Explanations for this community and associated phenomena vary in likelihood and scope. Firstly, residents of the third-world, for whom monkeys are a commonplace annoyance, and who do not partake in Western beliefs towards animal-rights, may be involved. It is possible that such residents could develop a psychopathic sadism towards monkeys. However, this does not explain the borderline fetishistic fixation on baby monkeys specifically; neither does it explain the mostly Western names of users.</p>
      <p>
	This may be an outlet for "cute aggression" or considering an issue with anthropomorphising the "uncanney valley"--concepts mentioned by community users--and it is difficult for me to mention this possibility without also considering that this is a proxy for child abuse. This theory is supported by the mismatch between the tame videos and the lurid ultraviolence in the comments, and by the fixation on baby monkeys of a specific species, macaques, who resemble humans. Also, there is a user in the community named "Peter Ridell", who uses the alias and photographic avatar of an alleged pedophile, "Peter Gerard Scully", and who makes references to pedophilia in comments.</p>

      <p>This all brings to mind Elsagate and child exploitation cults, but it is possible that only a minority of users are of such bent. It is plausible that some users are bots, sockpuppets, or hired agents--considering a motive to create a niche for ad revenue utilizing this drive. This could explain why the community either swarms a monkey video, or is not present at all. When the community is present, all the comments are typed in a similar style, including comments defending the monkeys.</p>

      <h2>Actions?</h2>
      <p>I wouldn't mind if this were reported to the ASPCA, or maybe even PETA. Otherwise, it's simply a curious phenomenon.</p>
